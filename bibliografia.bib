  abstract = {The relationship between influenza antigenic drift and vaccination

	In this paper, 1 review what is known about the effects of antigenic
	drift on vaccination and the effects of vaccination on antigenic
	drift, and I suggest some simple ways to detect the presence of antigenic
	drift in seasonal influenza data. If antigenic drift occurs on the
	time scale of a single influenza season, it may be associated with
	the presence of herd immunity at the beginning of the season and
	may indicate a need to monitor for vaccine updates at the end of
	the season. The relationship between antigenic drift and vaccination
	must also be viewed in the context of the global circulation of influenza
	strains and the seeding of local and regional epidemics. In the data
	sets I consider--from New Zealand, New York, and France--antigenic
	drift can be statistically detected during some seasons, and seeding
	of epidemics appears to be endogenous sometimes and exogenous at
	other times. Improved detection of short-term antigenic drift and
	epidemic seeding would significantly benefit influenza monitoring
	efforts and vaccine selection.},

  abstract = {Influenza continues to have a major worldwide impact, resulting in
	considerable human suffering and economic burden. The regular recurrence
	of influenza epidemics is thought to be caused by antigenic drift,
	and a number of studies have shown that sufficient changes can accumulate
	in the virus to allow influenza to reinfect the same host. To address
	this, influenza vaccine content is reviewed annually to ensure protection
	is maintained, despite the emergence of drift variants; however,
	it is not always possible to capture every significant drift, partly
	due to the timing of the recommendations. Vaccine mismatch can impact
	on vaccine effectiveness, and has significant epidemiological and
	economical consequences, as was seen most apparently in the 1997-1998
	influenza season. To meet the challenge of antigenic drift, vaccines
	that confer broad protection against heterovariant strains are needed
	against seasonal, epidemic and pandemic influenza. In addition to
	the use of vaccine adjuvants, emerging research areas include development
	of a universal vaccine and the use of vaccines that exploit mechanisms
	of cross-protective immunity.},

	are members of a simulated finite random lattice. An algorithm useful

	Background  The recent emergence of the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1
	virus has highlighted the value of free and open access to influenza
	virus genome sequence data integrated with information about other
	important virus characteristics. Design  The Influenza Research Database
	(IRD, http://www.fludb.org) is a free, open, publicly-accessible
	resource funded by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
	Diseases through the Bioinformatics Resource Centers program. IRD
	provides a comprehensive, integrated database and analysis resource
	for influenza sequence, surveillance, and research data, including
	user-friendly interfaces for data retrieval, visualization and comparative
	genomics analysis, together with personal log in-protected 'workbench'
	spaces for saving data sets and analysis results. IRD integrates
	genomic, proteomic, immune epitope, and surveillance data from a
	variety of sources, including public databases, computational algorithms,
	external research groups, and the scientific literature. Results To
	demonstrate the utility of the data and analysis tools available
	in IRD, two scientific use cases are presented. A comparison of hemagglutinin
	sequence conservation and epitope coverage information revealed highly
	conserved protein regions that can be recognized by the human adaptive
	immune system as possible targets for inducing cross-protective immunity.
	Phylogenetic and geospatial analysis of sequences from wild bird
	surveillance samples revealed a possible evolutionary connection
	between influenza virus from Delaware Bay shorebirds and Alberta
	ducks. Conclusions  The IRD provides a wealth of integrated data
	and information about influenza virus to support research of the
	genetic determinants dictating virus pathogenicity, host range restriction
	and transmission, and to facilitate development of vaccines, diagnostics,
	and therapeutics.},
